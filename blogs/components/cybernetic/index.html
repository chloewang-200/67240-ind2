                <p>I was introduced to the topic cyborg Day 1 at CMU. In our studio, I worked with my friend Leon Chueng
                    in designing a cyborg device that imagines and extends human capabilties.</p>

                <p>I had trouble grasping the concept of cyborg, and what we created was a quite literal representation
                    of cyborg üòπ We explored the idea of a symbiotic cyborg, where the mirrors served
                    as a way to synthesize the vision of the two entities in this cyborg system. The springs and the tubes
                    stresses the force and tension connecting and separating the two entities.

                 <div class = "sectionTitle">The Foundation üî®</div>
                <p> The topics of cyborg and cybernetics persisted throughout my studies at CMU, especially in
                    my computational design courses. I gradually gained interest in machine intelligence. My
                ultimate vision is to create a homeostatic, cybernetically-informed artifact/installation that is visually
            appealing, and imagines new ways of interation with humans. I envision this to be a physical system.</p>
            <img class = "blogMidImage" src="./imgs/alien-garden.png" />
            <p>I explored using Proccessing and Arduino to create an interactive, homeostatic system
                in 2D. Each cell in the system follows a pre-defined rule to change its state based on the state of its neighbors.
                The cells may be born, live, or die based on human interaction.
            </p>
            <img class = "blogImgCover" src="./imgs/cells.gif"/>
            <p>Finally, this project serves as an exploration to a cybernetic system, and my first explorations
                in building physical machines. I wanted to create a machine that breathes, and I wanted to see it
                in a system where each entity is connected and dependent on each other.

            <div class = "sectionTitle">The Setup üè†</div>
            <p> The setup is pretty straightforward. I used air pumps and Arduino to control the air pressure in the tubes. The tubes
                are connected to the air pumps and the Arduino. The Arduino is programmed to control the air pressure in the tubes
                to create a breathing effect.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img id = "stepImg" src = "./imgs/setup.png" />
            <br>
            <p>The hardest thing for me in this process was figuring out how to make the balloons breathe - 
                having air coming in and out of the tube at the same time. I wasn't able to find a air pump that can do this, so I had to
                experiment my own way to achieve this effect. I ended up using two air pumps, one to pump air in, and the other to pump air out.
                The two air pumps are connected to the same tube, and the Arduino is programmed to control the air pumps to create the breathing effect.

            <div class = "sectionTitle">The Result! üíó</div>
            <p>Here's the final result! Though it's on a smaller scale, I imagine it 
                developing into a larger, more complex system that can be used in an installation.
