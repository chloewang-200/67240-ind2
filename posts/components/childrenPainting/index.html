            <p>In the evolving landscape of digital art, the balance between complexity and simplicity is pivotal. As we delved into various imaging platforms, one stood out in its sophistication: MidJourney. Its generated images are undeniably realistic, yet they often miss a touch of ‚Äúnaiveness‚Äù that can deeply resonate with emotions. The images generated usually lack a texture of simplicity and frankness that arouses emotions. In my process of generating images on Mid-journey, even when I input prompts of abstract artists and styles, the generated photos remain noticeably developed or ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù. This led to an intriguing exploration: How might we leverage MidJourney to craft images that are ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù, ‚Äúchildish‚Äù, and ‚Äúnaive‚Äù, aiming to stir the very emotions we seek?</p>

            <p>.The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) 
                The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model is a deep learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of images and corresponding textual descriptions. Its objective is to learn to associate images and their textual descriptions by embedding them in a shared latent space. This shared space allows for the computation of the similarity between the images and their textual descriptions. CLIP has 3 stages:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pre-Training: The model is first pre-trained on a large dataset of image-caption pairs, with the aim of learning a shared representation of images and their textual descriptions. During pre-training, the model learns to predict which textual description corresponds to which image.</li>
                    <li>Fine-Tuning: The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on a specific task such as image classification, object detection, or visual question answering. The model is further fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset to improve its performance on that particular task.</li>
                    <li>Inference: When the model is presented with a new image or text, it computes the embeddings for both and compares their similarity in the shared latent space. The model assigns a higher score to image-text pairs that are semantically similar and a lower score to pairs that are dissimilar.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>For different room types, they would produce different room sizes according to the most common/standard
                commercial room sizes. For example, a bedroom would be 10'x12', a bathroom would be 5'x8', and a kitchen would be around 10'x10'.
            </p>
            <p>The dataset we decided to use is this <a href = "https://www.artsonia.com/museum/gallery.asp?project=2637768" target = "_blank">online gallery of
                children's paintings on emotions</a>. This is a great source to find naive art, as children's paintings are often naive and are a frank expression of
                their emotions. We used a web scraper to scrape the images and their corresponding titles and descriptions. We then used the CLIP model to embed the images and their descriptions into a shared latent space. We then used the embeddings to train a GAN model to generate naive art.
